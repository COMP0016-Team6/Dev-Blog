## Overview

We put our focus of the week on planning out the backend and database design that we need for our app. Also, to keep ourselves informed with all the tools we need on developing e.g., NodeJS and PostgreSQL.

## Back End Development

As we have decided to use NodeJS for our backend. We would like to work out the crucial components we need.

The following is the breakdown of the Back End Components:

- API endpoints:
    - /auth/login
        - POST – route to the login of the user. Assigns a token to the user when logged in successfully
    - /auth/register
        - POST – route to creating a new user account
    - /dashboard
        - POST – route to display the feed data of the patient or the list of patients of the clinician
    - /getFeeds
        - POST – route to fetch the feed data from the database
    - /patientInfo/id
        - POST – route to fetch the patient information according to the if specified
    - /myPatients/add
        - POST – route to adding or removing the access of a patient of the clinician
    - /patientInfo/changeTreatmentPlan
        - POST – route to change the treatment plan data of the patient

## Database Design

IPSO (Input, Process, Storage, Output) table

![IPSO Table](/Dev-Blog/assets/week9/IPSO.png)

This table is our draft of what data and process we need to perform or store, so that we can have a better idea on how we create our schema for the database.

We also dedicated time to creating the initial schema for our database using an Entity Relation Diagram.

ER Diagram.

The entity relation diagram demonstrates the basic tables we need for storing the information needed for our app and the relations in how they are linked together.

## Next Steps

Having looked more into how our front and back end and the database of our application should look like, we wish to start putting these ideas into actual development.
