On the *20th October 2020*, we met our clients and they shared the type of system they had in mind. Clients described it as a **FHIR-compliant data visualisation tool from Infusion Pumps**. We have verified that the tool will be a web application and not a mobile app.

Our team has also prepared additional questions to conduct a semi-structured interview get a better understanding of requirements. 

The system will be used in a clinical context, therefore, clients wanted us to get familiar with infusion pumps and asked to conduct primary research on different types of sensors used in infusion pumps and present the findings in the next meeting. Because of the busy schedule of the client, we agreed to meet biweekly on Tuesdays for an hour and asked for permission to record the meetings.

Shortly after the meeting, resources were shared to help us visualise the feeding pumps used in the UK for tube feeding children.

Overall, the meeting was productive and we were able to gather most of the requirements for the project. However, it may take some time for the team to learn about infusion pumps and conduct the research that clients asked for.
