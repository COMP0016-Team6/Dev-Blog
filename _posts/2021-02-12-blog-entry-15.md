## Overview 

Since we have finished the basic dashboard page for patients, we seek more improvements in functionalities. This week we concentrated on the personalized treatment plan, last modified time and add patient function. 

## Target

In the `change treatment plan` form, we tried to add a new function to allow the clinicians to set `Target Feed Volume`, `Target Energy Intake`, and enable the targets to be visualized on the patient’s dashboard. With this function, the clinicians can directly know if their setting targets are reasonable.

After filling in the inputs `Target Feed Volume` and `Target Energy Intake` and submitting the form, the database will update the treatment plan details. Specifically, the back-end server will perform `pool.query`, and then the treatment information inputs will be kept in the table `treatments`. In this progress, if any errors are caught, the system will inform “Treatment Plan Change Failed!”. Otherwise, it would be “Treatment Plan Change Successful!”.

## Last Modified Time

PostgreSQL provides two types of timestamp, which are `TIMESTAMP` and `TIMESTAMPZ`. Both of them can store the date and exact time, however, the biggest difference between them is `TIMESTAMP` cannot memory the time zone, which means if the time zone of the database server has changed, the time stored in it will not change. But in this project, since we think that the server’s time zone will be changed frequently, using `TIMESTAMP` is still a good choice.

After submitting the form of `change treatment plan` and saving the information to the table `treatments` in the database, the database server will automatically record the time of data input by timestamp.

## Add Patients

In our service for clinicians version, we also support the function that adds patients. On the `clinician dashboard` page, there are is a button at the bottom `Add Patients`, After clicking it, the system will return a search bar and a list of patients registered. Similar to other functions mentioned, the system uses `pool.query` to update the clinician’s patients scope. As a patient is added, the `user_perms` will update, `user_id` is the id of the clinician and `patient_scope` is the id of the patient. In this way, the clinician can manage their patients conveniently.

## Next Steps
For the next step, we will continually seek improvements in term of functionalities, specifically, make the search bar for the clinicians available and create a checkbox selecting system to make the whole system more functional.
