This week we continued our primary research into infusion pumps and now have a better understanding of the purpose of the project. We have made progress by reading official manuals and research papers about smart infusion pumps, to learn about its sensors and other components in detail.

Here are some of the documents we read through:

Work is still in progress with regards to the Power Point Presentation for next Tuesday. There are still some ambiguities with how this research relates with the system we want to build, so hopefully this will clear up in the future. Additional structured interviews will also be required to come up with a concrete MoSCoW Requirements.

Quite a bit of material has also been released for the HCI component, including Prototyping, Representing Users (Personas), and Design Principles. We will most likely focus more on the HCI segment next week for which the coursework has also been released.
