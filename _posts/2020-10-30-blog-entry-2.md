## Infusion Pumps and Client's Task

This week we continued our primary research into infusion pumps and now have a better understanding of the purpose of the project. We have made progress by reading official manuals and research papers about smart infusion pumps, which helped us gain a deeper understanding of the sensors and other components widely used in infusion pumps such as force sensors, pressure sensors and magnetic position sensor.

Some of the documents we read through:

Work is still in progress with regards to the Power Point Presentation for the client meeting next Tuesday. There are some ambiguities with how this research relates to the system we want to build, so hopefully, this will clear up in the future. Additional structured interviews will also be required to come up with a concrete MoSCoW Requirements.

## Further Questions

We do, however, still got some questions that we are curious about, so we sought help from our clients. Our clients did kindly reply to us and also provided us some useful information for us to further read on.

## Human Computer Interaction

We covered a lot of important content for the **Human Computer Interaction** (HCI) component of the module. It helped us, developers, to understand how to build interactive, effective, efficient user-centred design for the NHS Clinicians and for the parents that will be using our application. We will conduct additional interviews and apply the knowledge gained from lectures into practice by creating Personas, coming up with Scenarios, and building Prototypes.


## Next Steps

We will proceed with preparing questions for the semi-structured interview with the clients for next week to gain a better understanding of requirements, and will also work towards creating personas and sketches.
