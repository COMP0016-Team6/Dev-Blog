This week we continued our primary research into infusion pumps and now have a better understanding of the purpose of the project. We have made progress by reading official manuals and research papers about smart infusion pumps, which helped us gain deeper understanding of the sensors and other components widely used in infusion pumps such as force sensors, pressure sensors and magnetic position sensor.

Some of the documents we read through:

Work is still in progress with regards to the Power Point Presentation for the client meeting next Tuesday. There are some ambiguities with how this research relates with the system we want to build, so hopefully this will clear up in the future. Additional structured interviews will also be required to come up with a concrete MoSCoW Requirements.

We covered a lot of important content for the **Human Computer Interaction** (HCI) component of the module. It helped us, developers, to understand how to build interactive, effective, efficient user-centered design for the NHS Clinicians and for the parents that will be using our application. We will conduct additional interviews and apply the knowledge gained from lectures into practice by creating Personas, coming up with Scenarios, and building Prototypes.

We will proceed preparing question for the semi-structured interview with the clients for next week to gain a better understanding of requirements, and will also work towards starting the HCI coursework.
