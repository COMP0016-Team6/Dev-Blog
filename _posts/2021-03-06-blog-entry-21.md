## Overview

With most of the preparation finished in the last term, we have been focusing on the development side of the project throughout this second term. Documentations are also being added alongside the development process. After that, we did thorough testing of the program and deployed the app onto our server which gave us our [final product](https://dauletbatayev.com/).

## Development

The development process has occupied most of our time in this term. Since we have already familiarised ourselves with the tech stack the last term, we began straight by first creating the essential pages for our app, then keep on adding extra functionalities according to the MoSCoW requirements list and client feedbacks.

### Register and Login Page

First, we started development with the register and login page because we think that the authentication system is very important for the users. Both register and login page utilized `pool.query`. However, the difference is the register page inserts data into the database and the login page performs a query and gains data from the database. Also, the authentication system will assign a JWT to each valid user to track their login status.

### Paitent Dashboard

Developing a highly customisable dashboard is the main focus of this project. The patient dashboard page will be where the treatment data will be visualised. It will display the feed data graphs which is a `Linechart` component that imports form `react-chartjs-2`.

Functionalities on this page include filtering the data, select data type, add feedback and change treatment plan (clinicians only).

### Clinician Dashboard

On the clinician dashboard, it shows the list of patients supervised by the clinician. This page is only visible by a clinician. When the patient’s name is clicked, it will redirect to that patient’s dashboard. The main functionality here will be `Add Patients` which the clinician will be able to assign patients they supervise so that they will not see the patients they are not looking after.

![Clinician Dashboard]()

### Functionalities

#### Target Feed

On the patient dashboard page, there will be a target feed graph overlayed onto the feed graph. This allows both clinicians and patients to compare the prescribed feed and target feed, thus reviewing the feed quality.

##### Change Target Feed

Clinicians will be able to change a patient’s treatment plan to revise the prescribed feed for patients. In the change treatment plan form, which is below the patient dashboard by clicking the `Change treatment plan` button, the clinician will set the target feed volume and the target energy intake. Then, the database will update the treatment plan details by the back-end server performing a `pool.query`, and then the treatment information inputs will be kept in the table treatments which is then followed by a “Treatment Plan Change Successful!” message.

##### Last Modification Time

We did this by adding the field `last modified time` to the table `treatments`. PostgreSQL provides two types of timestamp, which are TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMPZ. Both of them can store the date and exact time, however, the biggest difference between them is TIMESTAMP cannot memory the time zone, which means if the time zone of the database server has changed, the time stored in it will not change. But in this project, since we think that the server’s time zone will be changed frequently, using TIMESTAMP is still a good choice.

After submitting the form of change treatment plan and saving the information to the table treatments in the database, the database server will automatically record the time of data input by timestamp.

#### Add Patients

This page is redirected to when the `Add patients` button is clicked on the clinician dashboard page. On this page, there will be a list of all patients stored in the database and the clinician will be assigned only the ones they are supervising by using the checkbox next to the patient names. This is because clinicians will only see the treatment data of the patients they are taking care of. This means if the patient is being added, the name of that patient will appear on the list on `Clinician Dashboard` page. As a patient is added, the `user_perms` will update, `user_id` is the id of the clinician and patient_scope is the id of the patient. In this way, the clinician can manage their patients conveniently.

#### Generating Feeds

To be able to simulate the data from the infusion pump, we have added data to the graph by generating feed data from the backend so we can simulate real data is being displayed. As we have no idea what kind of data exactly will be passed from the infusion pump (since there is no way for us to get hands-on an actual infusion pump), we did this to imitate the concept and functionality of the app. We created a `genFeeds.py` file that generates random dates and feed data with `Math.random`. The data generated will be then pushed and stored in the database, so it can then be used to visualise the line graph.

We used cron job to schedule to continuously run the `genFeeds.py` file to give us a large amount of data to be used. Cron job is a time-based job scheduler that gives the ability to do repetitive tasks. In our case, we used it to run the `genFeeds.py` file every 30 minutes, simulating the data fetched from the infusion pump every 30 minutes. We also make sure that all these data will be stored in the database and will not be discarded at any point.

#### Sort by Day/Month/Year

Another functionality we have added is the ability to show the line graph in different ways. Our previous graph was only capable of showing all the data we have collected, but it can be confusing and hard to keep track of to the user. Therefore, we decided to make the graph visible also by year, months and day. We have done this by implementing an option bar to let the user choose how they want to display. The option will be passed to the `LineChart` as a `filter` option when triggering `onchangeFilter`. On `LineChart`, we have added a function `filterFeed` to change the display accordingly. After determining what the filter option is, it will get the timestamps and feed data from the database.

#### Filter Date

This is another feature that allows users to view specific data on specific dates. We achieved this with the user of `RainbowDatepicker` from `react-rainbow-components`. It allows user to have a popup of a calendar to pick two dates which are the start and end date of the desired range. We then get that date and format it using `fornmatDates` to get the range of the date. Only the data within the range will then be determined and displayed on the graph.

#### Weight Graph

Our client reflected that a weight graph would be useful since they can extract information by comparing the change in weight to the feed rate. We decided then to overlay the weight graph onto the feed graph.

On the patient dashboard, we have added a `showWeight` check box which when on click, will show the weight graph. This is done by adding a weight graph to the `LineChart` component. To do this, we need to map the weight data using a `findWeights` function which returns the weights within the timestamp. The value of the weights will also be multiplied by a constant so that it will be in a similar range as the feed rate so that it can be better viewed.

#### User Feedback System

This feedback system is for clinicians or patients to leave a message on specific data points on the graph. This enables them to explain what happened at that moment which may justify the anomaly. We have added a component `Modal` which is a popup for the user to submit their feedback. After it is entered, the message will be stored in the database. Users will be able to view this by hovering on the point and there will be a new column `patient_feedback` added.

We later also changed the colour of the point if it is commented so that it is more visible on the graph. The feedback is also annotated with the user who gave the feedback, making it easier to track the messages.
